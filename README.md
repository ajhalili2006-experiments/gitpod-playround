# Andrei Jiroh's Personal Playround for Gitpod + Codespaces

This repository intentionally left empty, other than this README and some basic configuration (as per my dotfiles' bootstrap script for Ubuntu on Dockerfile)
due to some issues and to make things perfectly work. It merely serves as an entry point for personal Gitpod experiments. Originally hard-forked
from <https://github.com/corneliusludmann/gitpod-playground>.

## Usage

**Codespaces**: `<> Code` -> `Create codespace on main` or reuse existing codespace

**Gitpod**: [Quick link for GitHub](https://gitpod.io/#github.com/ajhalili2006-experiments/gitpod-playround) or [GitLab](https://gitpod.io/#gitlab.com/ajhalili2006-experiments/gitpod-playround)
